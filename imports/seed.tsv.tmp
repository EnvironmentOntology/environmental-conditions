Toxaphene was used from the mid-1940s as an agricultural insecticide (mostly in the USA, particularly on corn and soybeans). Usage increased with the phasing out of DDT in the 1970s and it became the most heavily manufactured pesticide in the US, but it is now banned as a result of concerns over its toxicity and carcinogenicity. It is estimated that total production since its first use was around half a million tons. In the environment, most of the components of toxaphene get metabolised, but from 10 to >100 resist biodegradation, depending on the medium and the specialisation of the enzyme system. Breathing, drinking or eating high levels of toxaphene can damage the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system.
