It is an inhibitor of dehydropeptidase I (membrane dipeptidase, 3.4.13.19), an enzyme found in the brush border of renal tubes and responsible for degrading the antibiotic imipenem. Cilastatin is therefore administered (as the sodium salt) with  imipenem to prolong the antibacterial effect of the latter by preventing its renal metabolism to inactive and potentially nephrotoxic products. Cilastatin also acts as a leukotriene D4 dipeptidase inhibitor, preventing the metabolism of leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4." xsd:string

The hydrochloride salt can be used in intravenous infusions. Metronidazole is a prodrug and is selective for anaerobic bacteria due to their ability to intracellularly reduce the nitro group of metronidazole to give nitroso-containing intermediates. These can covalently bind to DNA, disrupting its helical structure, inducing DNA strand breaks and inhibiting bacterial nucleic acid synthesis, ultimately resulting in bacterial cell death." xsd:string

Toxaphene was used from the mid-1940s as an agricultural insecticide (mostly in the USA, particularly on corn and soybeans). Usage increased with the phasing out of DDT in the 1970s and it became the most heavily manufactured pesticide in the US, but it is now banned as a result of concerns over its toxicity and carcinogenicity. It is estimated that total production since its first use was around half a million tons. In the environment, most of the components of toxaphene get metabolised, but from 10 to >100 resist biodegradation, depending on the medium and the specialisation of the enzyme system. Breathing, drinking or eating high levels of toxaphene can damage the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system." xsd:string
