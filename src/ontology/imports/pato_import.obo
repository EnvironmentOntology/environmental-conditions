comment: We use the has_part relation to relate complex qualities to more primitive ones. A complex quality is a collection of qualities. The complex quality cannot exist without the sub-qualities. For example, the quality 'swollen' necessarily comes with the qualities of 'protruding' and 'increased size'.

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.
