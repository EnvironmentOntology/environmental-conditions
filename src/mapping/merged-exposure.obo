It has been identified in surface and drinking water, ambient air, exhaust emissions, smoke of cigarettes and cigars, and in smoked foods and edible aquatic organisms. It is primarily used as an intermediate in the production of dyes, smoke screens, scintillation counter crystals, and in organic semiconductor research. Although a large body of literature exists on the toxicity of PAHs, data for anthracene are limited. Prolonged exposure causes variety of topical and systemic adverse reactions.

def: "A synthetic, white crystalline solid that is practically insoluble in water and soluble in ether, chloroform, carbon disulfide, benzene, alcohol and acetone. It is used primarily as a space deodorant in products such as room deodorizers, urinal and toilet bowl blocks, and as an insecticide fumigant for moth control. When 1,4-dichlorobenzene is heated to decomposition, toxic gases and vapors (such as hydrochloric acid and carbon monoxide) are released. The primary route of potential human exposure to this compound is inhalation. Acute inhalation exposure to 1,4-dichlorobenzene can result in coughing and breathing difficulties. Breathing high levels of this chemical can cause headaches, dizziness and liver damage. Contact with 1,4-dichlorobenzene can irritate the eyes, leading to burning and tearing. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)" [NCIT:C44297]

def: "A synthetic, flammable, colorless liquid that is slightly soluble in water, and miscible with most aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, ethers and the lower carboxylic acids. It is used primarily both as a chemical intermediate and as a solvent for numerous commercial products. 2-Nitropropane is also used as a component of explosives and propellants, and in fuels for internal combustion engines. The primary routes of potential human exposure to 2-nitropropane are dermal contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Contact with this compound can cause irritation of the eyes and skin. Acute inhalation exposure to low levels of 2-nitropropane vapors can result in irritation of the respiratory tract. Breathing higher levels of this chemical may cause anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)" [NCIT:C44313]

name: Vinyl Chloride
def: "A chlorinated hydrocarbon occurring as a colorless, highly flammable gas with a mild, sweet odor that may emit toxic fumes of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride and phosgene when heated to decomposition. Vinyl chloride is primarily used to make polyvinyl chloride to manufacture plastics. Exposure to this substance affects the central and peripheral nervous system and causes liver damage. Prolonged exposure to vinyl chloride can cause a set of symptoms that is characterized by Raynaud's phenomenon, joint and muscle pain and scleroderma-like skin changes. Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen and is associated with an increased risk of developing liver cancer, predominantly angiosarcoma of the liver, but is also linked to brain and lung cancer as well as cancer of the lymphatic and hematopoietic system.

A plant treatment is the most specific,and may be a component of a plant growing condition, and the plant study type. The broadest classes are the plant study types where the terms can be used to identify the growth study facility. Each growth facility such as field study, growth chamber, green house etc is a environment on its own and it may also involve instances of biotic and abiotic treatments and different growing conditions.

comment: This type of herbicides are taken up by plant root and leaf tissue and transported to the meristems via both phloem and xylem. The herbicide stops the activity of the enzyme, acetolactate synthase (ALS), which is involved in branch chain amino acid (valine, leucine and isoleucine) synthesis.

Red light is electromagnetic radiation of wavelength of 580-700nm. Far red light is electromagnetic radiation of wavelength 700-800nm. An example of this response is seen at the beginning of many plant species developmental stages. These include germination, and the point when cotyledon expansion is triggered. In certain species these processes take place in response to absorption of red light by the pigment molecule phytochrome, but the signal can be reversed by exposure to far red light. During the initial phase the phytochrome molecule is only present in the red light absorbing form, but on absorption of red light it changes to a far red light absorbing form, triggering progress through development. An immediate short period of exposure to far red light entirely returns the pigment to its initial state and prevents triggering of the developmental process. A thirty minute break between red and subsequent far red light exposure renders the red light effect irreversible, and development then occurs regardless of whether far red light exposure subsequently occurs."

Published data indicate that renal fibrosis is associated with the chronic consumption of MSG and oxidative stress is the main cause of kidney injury [PMID:26493866].

comment: Pesticide are unique chemicals as they are intrinsically toxic for several biological targets, are deliberately spread into the environment, and their toxicity has a limited species selectivity. Pesticide toxicity depends on the compound family and is generally greater for the older compounds; in humans, they are responsible for acute poisonings as well as for long term health effects, including cancer and adverse effects on reproduction.

Upon intravenous administration of the anti-CD20 B9E9 scFv-SA fusion protein, this agent targets and binds to CD20-expressing tumor cells. Subsequently, a biotinylated N-acetylgalactosamine-containing clearing agent is administered, which binds to the streptavidin moiety of the unbound fusion protein and promotes its hepatic excretion. In turn, radiolabeled DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid)-biotin is administered and, due to its small size, quickly distributes. The biotin moiety efficiently binds to the SA moiety of the bound fusion protein, which localizes the biotin-conjugated radionuclide to the tumor site. CD20, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is overexpressed on B-cell malignancies. PRIT increases both tumor uptake and renal elimination of the radionuclide conjugate as compared to conventional radioimmunotherapy (RIT), where the radioisotope is bound to the antibody before administration; this increases the dose of radionuclide delivered to the tumor while limiting radiation exposure for normal, healthy tissues."

Upon intravenous administration of the docetaxel-loaded nanopharmaceutical CRLX301, the nanoparticles are able to accumulate at the tumor site due to the unique characteristics of the tumor's vasculature, while avoiding normal, healthy tissue. In turn, CRLX301 is taken up by the tumor cell via macropinocytosis. Subsequently, docetaxel is slowly released into the cytoplasm where it binds to and stabilizes the beta-subunit of tubulin, thereby stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting microtubule disassembly. This prevents mitosis and results in cell death. Compared to the administration of docetaxel alone, this formulation is able to increase docetaxel's efficacy while avoiding systemic exposure, which minimizes its toxicity." [NCIT:C121539]

Alpha interferons are cytokines produced by nucleated cells (predominantly natural killer (NK) leukocytes) upon exposure to live or inactivated virus, double-stranded RNA or bacterial products.  These agents bind to specific cell-surface receptors, resulting in the transcription and translation of genes containing an interferon-specific response element.  The proteins so produced mediate many complex effects, including antiviral effects (viral protein synthesis); antiproliferative effects (cellular growth inhibition and alteration of cellular differentiation); anticancer effects (interference with oncogene expression); and immune-modulating effects (natural killer cell activation, alteration of cell surface antigen expression, and augmentation of lymphocyte and macrophage cytotoxicity).

Another consequence of beta-lactam exposure results in the loss of lipoteichoic acids from the cell wall.

Compared to camptothecin alone, the cyclodextrin-based polymer formulation has a prolonged half life and greatly improves the biodistribution of camptothecin resulting in an accumulation of camptothecin at the tumor site, which enhances tumor exposure while greatly reducing toxic side effects.

This agent is designed to deliver the active metabolite to tumor cells without the need for conversion as is the case with irinotecan. Compared to unPEGylated 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, PEGylation improves solubility and allows for parental delivery, and may result in a longer half-life and higher exposure for tumor cells."

def: "For continuants: C part_of C' if and only if: given any c that instantiates C at a time t, there is some c' such that c' instantiates C' at time t, and c *part_of* c' at t. For processes: P part_of P' if and only if: given any p that instantiates P at a time t, there is some p' such that p' instantiates P' at time t, and p *part_of* p' at t. (Here *part_of* is the instance-level part-relation.)" [PMID:15892874]
comment: Parthood as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation p part_of p1 is illustrated in assertions such as: this instance of rhodopsin mediated phototransduction part_of this instance of visual perception.    This relation satisfies at least the following standard axioms of mereology: reflexivity (for all p, p part_of p); anti-symmetry (for all p, p1, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p then p and p1 are identical); and transitivity (for all p, p1, p2, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p2, then p part_of p2). Analogous axioms hold also for parthood as a relation between spatial regions.    For parthood as a relation between continuants, these axioms need to be modified to take account of the incorporation of a temporal argument. Thus for example the axiom of transitivity for continuants will assert that if c part_of c1 at t and c1 part_of c2 at t, then also c part_of c2 at t.    Parthood as a relation between classes: To define part_of as a relation between classes we again need to distinguish the two cases of continuants and processes, even though the explicit reference to instants of time now falls away. For continuants, we have C part_of C1 if and only if any instance of C at any time is an instance-level part of some instance of C1 at that time, as for example in: cell nucleus part_ of cell.
