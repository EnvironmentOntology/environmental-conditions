name: response to red or far red light
def: "Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a red or far red light stimulus. Red light is electromagnetic radiation of wavelength of 580-700nm. Far red light is electromagnetic radiation of wavelength 700-800nm. An example of this response is seen at the beginning of many plant species developmental stages. These include germination, and the point when cotyledon expansion is triggered. In certain species these processes take place in response to absorption of red light by the pigment molecule phytochrome, but the signal can be reversed by exposure to far red light. During the initial phase the phytochrome molecule is only present in the red light absorbing form, but on absorption of red light it changes to a far red light absorbing form, triggering progress through development. An immediate short period of exposure to far red light entirely returns the pigment to its initial state and prevents triggering of the developmental process. A thirty minute break between red and subsequent far red light exposure renders the red light effect irreversible, and development then occurs regardless of whether far red light exposure subsequently occurs."

def: "An alkaloid found in low concentrations in plants in the Solanaceae family, which includes tobacco and tomato plants, with potential nicotine mimetic and anti-inflammatory activities. Following oral administration, anatabine may mimic the neurological effects of nicotine exposure. This agent may not have the addictive properties of nicotine; therefore, it may be appropriate for use in treating nicotine withdrawal symptoms during smoking cessation. Anatabine may also exert its anti-inflammatory effect by the inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) which then prevents the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), which is a key regulator of proinflammatory cytokine release. Urine concentrations of anatabine can be used to assess the extent of tobacco use." [NCIT:C114277]

def: "A topical formulation containing the naturally-derived biomaterial keratin that has wound repair promoting, hemostatic, moisturizing and potential radioprotective activities. Upon topical application to an injured site, keratin adheres to the injured tissue, and forms an extracellular matrix that mimics the structure and function of the native tissue. This exogenous extracellular matrix is able to absorb fluid, accelerate thrombus formation through beta1 integrin-mediated platelet adhesion and forms a physical seal on the wound. This facilitates tissue regeneration by promoting cellular proliferation and migration, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression and altering the expression of extracellular matrix components and adhesion molecules. Altogether, this promotes wound healing and provides protection from damage due to thermal or radiation exposure. Keratin is an essential component in nails, hair and skin." [NCIT:C116717]

Upon intravenous administration of the anti-CD20 B9E9 scFv-SA fusion protein, this agent targets and binds to CD20-expressing tumor cells. Subsequently, a biotinylated N-acetylgalactosamine-containing clearing agent is administered, which binds to the streptavidin moiety of the unbound fusion protein and promotes its hepatic excretion. In turn, radiolabeled DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid)-biotin is administered and, due to its small size, quickly distributes. The biotin moiety efficiently binds to the SA moiety of the bound fusion protein, which localizes the biotin-conjugated radionuclide to the tumor site. CD20, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is overexpressed on B-cell malignancies. PRIT increases both tumor uptake and renal elimination of the radionuclide conjugate as compared to conventional radioimmunotherapy (RIT), where the radioisotope is bound to the antibody before administration; this increases the dose of radionuclide delivered to the tumor while limiting radiation exposure for normal, healthy tissues."

Upon intravenous administration of the docetaxel-loaded nanopharmaceutical CRLX301, the nanoparticles are able to accumulate at the tumor site due to the unique characteristics of the tumor's vasculature, while avoiding normal, healthy tissue. In turn, CRLX301 is taken up by the tumor cell via macropinocytosis. Subsequently, docetaxel is slowly released into the cytoplasm where it binds to and stabilizes the beta-subunit of tubulin, thereby stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting microtubule disassembly. This prevents mitosis and results in cell death. Compared to the administration of docetaxel alone, this formulation is able to increase docetaxel's efficacy while avoiding systemic exposure, which minimizes its toxicity." [NCIT:C121539]

Cefditoren pivoxil is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed by intestinal esterases during absorption to the microbiologically active cefditoren, an active aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. Cefditoren inactivates penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) thereby interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis and inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. Another consequence of beta-lactam exposure results in the loss of lipoteichoic acids from the cell wall.

Due to decreased pH at the tumor site, the linker is cleaved and the chelated active moiety DACH-Pt is released in tumor cells. DACH-Pt alkylates macromolecules and causes both inter- and intra-strand platinum-DNA crosslinks, which impede DNA replication and transcription, thereby resulting in cell-cycle independent cytotoxicity.

def: "For continuants: C part_of C' if and only if: given any c that instantiates C at a time t, there is some c' such that c' instantiates C' at time t, and c *part_of* c' at t. For processes: P part_of P' if and only if: given any p that instantiates P at a time t, there is some p' such that p' instantiates P' at time t, and p *part_of* p' at t. (Here *part_of* is the instance-level part-relation.)" [PMID:15892874]
comment: Parthood as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation p part_of p1 is illustrated in assertions such as: this instance of rhodopsin mediated phototransduction part_of this instance of visual perception.    This relation satisfies at least the following standard axioms of mereology: reflexivity (for all p, p part_of p); anti-symmetry (for all p, p1, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p then p and p1 are identical); and transitivity (for all p, p1, p2, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p2, then p part_of p2). Analogous axioms hold also for parthood as a relation between spatial regions.    For parthood as a relation between continuants, these axioms need to be modified to take account of the incorporation of a temporal argument. Thus for example the axiom of transitivity for continuants will assert that if c part_of c1 at t and c1 part_of c2 at t, then also c part_of c2 at t.    Parthood as a relation between classes: To define part_of as a relation between classes we again need to distinguish the two cases of continuants and processes, even though the explicit reference to instants of time now falls away. For continuants, we have C part_of C1 if and only if any instance of C at any time is an instance-level part of some instance of C1 at that time, as for example in: cell nucleus part_ of cell.
