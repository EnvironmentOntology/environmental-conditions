This wafer contains the biodegradable copolymer PLGA (poly(lactide-co-glycolide) as the major drug delivery vehicle which is slowly degraded into water and carbon dioxide thereby continously releasing BCNU over approximately 3-4 weeks. Compared to systemic administration of BCNU alone, this local SR formulation is able to maintain higher drug concentrations locally over a longer period of time while minimizing exposure to other tissues."

Following exposure to this agent, EGFR expression status can be determined and EGFR overexpressing tumor cells can be visualized using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

Anatabine may also exert its anti-inflammatory effect by the inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) which then prevents the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), which is a key regulator of proinflammatory cytokine release.

Upon topical application to an injured site, keratin adheres to the injured tissue, and forms an extracellular matrix that mimics the structure and function of the native tissue. This exogenous extracellular matrix is able to absorb fluid, accelerate thrombus formation through beta1 integrin-mediated platelet adhesion and forms a physical seal on the wound. This facilitates tissue regeneration by promoting cellular proliferation and migration, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression and altering the expression of extracellular matrix components and adhesion molecules. Altogether, this promotes wound healing and provides protection from damage due to thermal or radiation exposure. Keratin is an essential component in nails, hair and skin." [NCIT:C116717]

def: "An Escherichia coli periplasm-expressed tetrameric fusion protein composed of four single-chain variable regions (scFv) of the murine immunoglobulin (Ig) G2a anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody B9E9 fused to the streptavidin (SA) gene of Streptomyces avidinii (scFv-SA), with potential use in pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT). Upon intravenous administration of the anti-CD20 B9E9 scFv-SA fusion protein, this agent targets and binds to CD20-expressing tumor cells. Subsequently, a biotinylated N-acetylgalactosamine-containing clearing agent is administered, which binds to the streptavidin moiety of the unbound fusion protein and promotes its hepatic excretion. In turn, radiolabeled DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid)-biotin is administered and, due to its small size, quickly distributes. The biotin moiety efficiently binds to the SA moiety of the bound fusion protein, which localizes the biotin-conjugated radionuclide to the tumor site. CD20, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is overexpressed on B-cell malignancies. PRIT increases both tumor uptake and renal elimination of the radionuclide conjugate as compared to conventional radioimmunotherapy (RIT), where the radioisotope is bound to the antibody before administration; this increases the dose of radionuclide delivered to the tumor while limiting radiation exposure for normal, healthy tissues."

Upon intravenous administration of the docetaxel-loaded nanopharmaceutical CRLX301, the nanoparticles are able to accumulate at the tumor site due to the unique characteristics of the tumor's vasculature, while avoiding normal, healthy tissue. In turn, CRLX301 is taken up by the tumor cell via macropinocytosis. Subsequently, docetaxel is slowly released into the cytoplasm where it binds to and stabilizes the beta-subunit of tubulin, thereby stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting microtubule disassembly. This prevents mitosis and results in cell death. Compared to the administration of docetaxel alone, this formulation is able to increase docetaxel's efficacy while avoiding systemic exposure, which minimizes its toxicity." [NCIT:C121539]

Its exact pharmacology is not fully understood due to the complexity of the herbal mixture and may involve multiple metabolic pathways. Exposure to PC-SPES in vitro has resulted in a decreased expression of genes encoding cell cycle regulatory proteins as well as an upregulation of genes that modulate apoptosis in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cells. The PC in the acronym PC-SPES stands for Prostate Cancer, while SPES is the Latin word for hope." [NCIT:C1828]

With topical liposomal delivery, the DNA repair enzyme T4-bacteriophage endonuclease V is transported into skin cells, where the enzyme enters cell nuclei and binds to and incises pyrimidine dimers, thereby catalyzing the first reaction step of the cellular excision repair pathway for removing DNA replication-inhibiting pyrimidine dimers produced within duplex DNA through exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that T4N5 liposomes increases repair of DNA damage caused by UV irradiation. (NCI05)" [NCIT:C2408]

def: "Anthracene, also called paranaphthalene or green oil, a solid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) consisting of three benzene rings derived from coal-tar, is the simplest tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.  It is on the EPA's priority pollutant list. It is ubiquitous in the environment as a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. It has been identified in surface and drinking water, ambient air, exhaust emissions, smoke of cigarettes and cigars, and in smoked foods and edible aquatic organisms. It is primarily used as an intermediate in the production of dyes, smoke screens, scintillation counter crystals, and in organic semiconductor research. Although a large body of literature exists on the toxicity of PAHs, data for anthracene are limited. Prolonged exposure causes variety of topical and systemic adverse reactions. Carcinogenicity bioassays with anthracene generally gave negative results." [NCIT:C251]

Because the commercial production and use of 2-naphthylamine are banned, the potential for human exposure is low. The general population may be exposed to this chemical through inhalation of emissions from sources where nitrogen-containing organic matter is burned, such as coal furnaces and cigarettes. At greatest risk of occupational exposure to 2-naphthylamine are laboratory technicians and scientists who use it in research. Acute inhalation exposure to high levels of 2-naphthylamine can result in methemoglobinemia, dyspnea, ataxia, hematuria, dysuria and hemorrhagic cystitis. It is known to be a human carcinogen.

Cefditoren inactivates penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) thereby interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis and inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. Another consequence of beta-lactam exposure results in the loss of lipoteichoic acids from the cell wall. Lipoteichoic acids inhibit murein hydrolase activity and their absence from the cell wall triggers uncontrolled autolytic activity rendering bacterial cells susceptible to osmotic shock. This results in a reduction of cell wall stability and causes cell lysis." [NCIT:C47434]

Endogenous interferons beta are cytokines produced by nucleated cells (predominantly natural killer cells) upon exposure to live or inactivated virus, double-stranded RNA or bacterial products. These agents bind to specific cell-surface receptors, resulting in the transcription and translation of genes with an interferon-specific response element. The proteins so produced mediate many complex effects, including antiviral (the most important being inhibition of viral protein synthesis), antiproliferative and immune modulating effects. The recombinant therapeutic forms of interferon beta are interferon beta 1-a and interferon beta 1-b. (NCI05)" [NCIT:C495]

Although the mechanism is not well understood, chloroquine is shown to inhibit the parasitic enzyme heme polymerase that converts the toxic heme into non-toxic hemazoin, thereby resulting in the accumulation of toxic heme within the parasite. This agent may also interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids. Chloroquine's potential chemosensitizing and radiosensitizing activities in cancer may be related to its inhibition of autophagy, a cellular mechanism involving lysosomal degradation that minimizes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) related to tumor reoxygenation and tumor exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation."

def: "A quinolinemethanol derivative with antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, and potential chemosensitization and radiosensitization activities. Although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, mefloquine, a weak base, preferentially accumulates in lysosomes and disrupts lysosomal function and integrity, thereby leading to host cell death. Similar to chloroquine, the chemosensitizing and radiosensitizing activities of this agent may be related to its inhibition of autophagocytosis, a cellular mechanism involving lysosomal degradation that minimizes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) related to tumor reoxygenation and tumor exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. Compared to chloroquine, mefloquine has better blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetration." [NCIT:C61827]

Compared to camptothecin alone, the cyclodextrin-based polymer formulation has a prolonged half life and greatly improves the biodistribution of camptothecin resulting in an accumulation of camptothecin at the tumor site, which enhances tumor exposure while greatly reducing toxic side effects.

After hydrolysis in vivo, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38), an active metabolite of irinotecan, is released from polyethyleneglycol-7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (PEG-SN38); 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin selectively stabilizes topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, resulting in single-stranded and double-stranded DNA breaks, the inhibition of DNA replication, and the induction of apoptosis. This agent is designed to deliver the active metabolite to tumor cells without the need for conversion as is the case with irinotecan. Compared to unPEGylated 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, PEGylation improves solubility and allows for parental delivery, and may result in a longer half-life and higher exposure for tumor cells."

Upon intratumoral injection, paclitaxel is released slowly and continuously into tumor tissues from the gelled thermosensitive triblock copolymer over a period of 4 to 6 weeks; in tumor cells, paclitaxel binds to tubulin and inhibits the disassembly-assembly dynamics of microtubules, resulting in cell cycle arrest and cell death. The thermosensitive triblock copolymer component of this formulation transforms from a water-soluble polymer at room temperature to a water-insoluble, biodegradable gel depot at body temperature; intratumoral controlled-release of paclitaxel from the gel minimizes systemic exposure to paclitaxel and the paclitaxel toxicity profile."

def: "A malignant neoplasm that arises from mesothelial cells in the pleura and shows a diffuse growth pattern.  It arises on the parietal and sometimes visceral pleura as multiple small nodules that later become confluent and invade the chest wall adipose tissue and muscle.  Asbestos exposure is the main cause for the development of pleural malignant mesothelioma. It usually affects patients over sixty years of age. The latency period is long.

These TGF-beta-resistant T-lymphocytes are exposed ex-vivo to dendritic cells (DCs) transfected with a replication-deficient adenovirus encoding EBV LMP; subsequent exposure to LMP1- or LMP2-expressing lymphoblastoid cell lines is used to expand the CTL.  Administered to patients with EBV-positive tumors, TGF-beta-resistant LMP-specific CTL target LMP-positive cells, which may result in a specific CTL response, followed by cell lysis and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.

Upon administration, anti-CD3 x anti-CD20 bispecific antibody-armed activated T cells (AATC) attach to CD3-expressing T cells and CD20-expressing tumor cells, selectively cross-linking T cells and tumor cells. This may result in the recruitment and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTLs), CTL-mediated specific tumor cell lysis, and the secretion of antitumor cytokines and chemokines. CD20, a cell surface phosphoprotein, is found on normal B cells and most B-cell tumors." [NCIT:C95751]
